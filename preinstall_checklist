echo $HISTSIZE
If you're getting a low number like 500 or so, make Bash's history unlimited with the following :

HISTSIZE=-1; HISTFILESIZE=-1
Before rebooting:

git clone https://github.com/andrewb91/install
cd install
chmod +x packages.sh
./packages.sh

Just before every reboot, copy your /root/.bash_history file to a USB stick (or anywhere that will still be there after a reboot or shutdown). Keep doing this until the installation is completely finished.
If after the first reboot you log in with a regular user account and sudo the commands, you should copy ~/.bash_history into safety from now on. Again, just before each reboot, and until the installation is completely finished.
Also copy .bash_history after the last command of the whole installation.
